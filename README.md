# Onchain Reads

Onchain Reads is a decentralized social network for book enthusiasts.

The platform allows users to create virtual bookshelves, where they can organize and track the books they've read, are currently reading, or plan to read in the future. Users can also rate and review books and provide recommendations.

Onchain Reads provides a space for users to connect with like-minded individuals and participate in communities. Users can explore new books based on their interests and engage in discussions with fellow readers.

["Centralized social networks place more restrictions on what users and developers can do."](https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks) By hosting the data on a decentralized platform, the content is censorship-resistant and allows developers to create applications and enable new social primitives permissionlessly.

**I'm seeking avid readers who can join me in building the best onchain discovery system for books**, and who will ultimately become integral members of this community. [Send me](mailto:carlos@pincaster.xyz) your desert island, all-time, top-five most memorable ~breakups~ book recommendations.

## Install and development

## Usage

Onchain Reads enables users to write reviews for the books they've read and access reviews contributed by other users. Users can:

- Write reviews for books they've read.
- Add books that aren't already listed.

Furthermore, Onchain Reads serves as a reputation and recommendation system, helping users discover new books. It could also expand its coverage to include additional resources such as blogs, podcasts, newsletters, movies, TV shows, places, and apps.
